# Create3Factory

Simple factory that can deploy contract with Create3 method from Solmate. Authority contract from Solmate is added on top of this contract, to controle who can use this factory.

## Why

- It aims to be the central point of deployment for all contracts for a DAO. 

- DAO can authorize someone else to deploy contracts on their behalf for example to a EOA-deployer, in order to acvhive cross-chain replication.
